Project: Bank customer churn prediction

Project's Workflow:

1. Data collection:
   Data for the project is collected from kaggle site for the learning purposes. It consists of 12 columns, and we have to determine whether a customer will left the bank or not on the basis of given data input.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   In this phase, different visualizations are explored in order to understand the co-relation between different columns like barplot, countplot, piechart, boxplot etc.

3. Data/Model Training:
   The data is first split into train and test in the ratio 8:2, then the data is fitted with different models like random forest classifier, logistic regression.

4. Model Selection:
   The Random Forest Classifier model is selected among all because it has highest accuracy score which is 87%.

5. Deployment:
   The model's deployment is done locally using Streamlit framework. And when providing input to the model, the model gives accurate result.
